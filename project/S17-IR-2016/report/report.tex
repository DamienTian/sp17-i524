\begin{abstract}
Analysis of flight data provides insights on the United States of
America's Airline data. The On-time performance of flights operated by
large air carriers are tracked and made as a report, Air Travel
Consumer Report, which is a big data set. Hive component of Hadoop
ecosystem, is utilized to process the big data in distributed
environment. Efficient accessing and processing of the user queries is
acheived by this analysis on flight data.

\section{Introduction}

Aviation industry manages enormous amount of data, which consists of
the information regarding the delayed, cancelled, diverted or on-time
flights by large air-carriers\cite{aviationanalysis}. This statistics
is publicly available in the Air Travel Consumer Report. Big Data
analysis of this data will provide a consistent understanding and
importance of the given data. With 35 million flight departures per
year, data is critically important for any planning decision made by
airlines and airports. The results of analysis has benefits which can
help airline operations to predict and reduce
redundance\cite{bigdatainaviation}.

\section{Milestones}

\begin{itemize}
\item Performing Analysis on local VM
\subitem Loading Data into HDFS
\subitem Pre-processing of the data using Pig
\subitem This data into Hive tables
\item Analysis on the distributed cloud environment
\item Visualizing the results using Tableau
\item Benchmarking
\item Final update with report
\end{itemize}


\section{Technologies}

\begin{itemize}
\item Distributed Computation and Storage:- HDFS, Hive and Pig
\item Development:- Python and Java
\item Deployment:- Ansible
\end{itemize}

\section{Deployment}
Ansible Playbook is used as the application and configuration
deployment tool. Deploying the Hive and Pig framework into the
cluster environment. 

\section{Benchmarking}
TBD
